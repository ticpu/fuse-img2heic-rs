# FUSE Image Converter Configuration
# This config will be automatically copied to ~/.config/fuse-img2heic-rs/config.yaml if not found

# Mount point for the FUSE filesystem
mount_point: "/tmp/fuse-img2heic"

# Source paths to scan for images
source_paths:
  # Recursive scan of Pictures directory
  - path: "~/Pictures"
    recursive: true

  # Non-recursive scan of Downloads (for quick access to recent downloads)
  - path: "~/Downloads"
    recursive: false

  # Add more paths as needed
  # - path: "/media/photos"
  #   recursive: true

# Filename patterns to match (regex)
filename_patterns:
  - ".*\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|heic|webp|bmp|tiff)$"

# HEIC conversion settings
heic_settings:
  # Quality: 1-100 (higher = better quality, larger file size)
  # Recommended: 40-60 for good compression, 70-85 for high quality
  quality: 40

  # Speed: 1-10 (higher = faster encoding, may reduce compression efficiency)
  # Recommended: 4-6 for balanced speed/compression
  speed: 4

  # Chroma subsampling: 420, 422, or 444
  # 420 = best compression (recommended for photos)
  # 422 = balanced
  # 444 = no chroma subsampling (larger files)
  chroma: 420

# Cache settings
cache:
  # Maximum cache size in MB (converted images are cached for faster access)
  # Set to 0 to disable memory caching (not recommended)
  max_size_mb: 1024

  # Custom cache directory (optional)
  # If not specified, uses ~/.cache/fuse-img2heic-rs
  # cache_dir: "/custom/cache/path"

# Logging configuration
logging:
  # Log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace
